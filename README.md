# Data Analysis Practice - *Readme in progress*

## Overview

I'm learning data analysis through a Discord channel that I found through Reddit. Each week will feature a different exploratory analysis project along with data cleaning, visualization practice, statistical analysis and data storytelling. Most if not all of the datasets will be from Kaggle.

This week's project analyzes how certain factors influence a country's happiness. The dataset that we will be working with is from Kaggle. The data has been modified to contain only data from 2015 to 2017. This report ranks 155 countries by their happiness level through 6 indicators:

* economic production
* social support
* life expectancy
* freedom
* absence of corruption
* generosity
* dystopia residual

### Understanding the column data

* Country
* Happiness rank
* Happiness score
   - This is obtained from a sample of population. The survey-taker asked the respondent to rate their happiness from 1 to 10.
* Economic (GDP per cap)
   - To what extent does GDP contribute to the happiness score
* Family
   - To what extent does family contribute to the happiness score
* Health
   - To what extent does health (life expectancy) contribute to the happiness score
* Freedom
   - To what extent does freedom contribute to the happiness score. Freedom in this context represents the freedom of speech, freedom to pursue what we want, etc
* Trust (Government corruption)
   - To what extent does trust (government corruption) contribute to the happiness score
* Generosity
   - To what extent does generosity contribute to the happiness score
* Dystopia residual
   - Dystopia residual is "the Dystopia Happiness Score(1.85) + the Residual value or the unexplained value for each country". Dystopia is a made up country that has the world's least happiest people. This made up country is high in corruption, low in average income, employment, etc. Dystopia residual is used as a benchmark and should be used side-by-side with the happiness score.
     * Low dystopia residual = low level of happiness
     * High dystopia residual = high level of happiness
* Year
